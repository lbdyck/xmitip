XMITIPTD - XMITIP Timed Delivery

This utility is designed to be run in a batch job that is scheduled
using the installations production batch scheduling system.

The schedule is granular to the day so the batch job only needs to
be scheduled to run once per day.

The syntax is:

   %xmitiptd control-data-set

The control data set is a PDS with members.

Members that begin with TD are the timed-delivery control members
that are processed by the code. The other members are ignored unless
referenced by the TDxxxxxx members.

The records within the TDxxxxxx members are sequenced thus:

Record - description

1 - day(s) of the week (Sunday, Monday, ...)
    multiple days are allowed separated by blanks
    or a day of the month (e.g. 15)
    multiple are allowed separated by blanks
2 - Name of the owner of this request or the contact
    person. Should have name and e-mail address
3 - SUBJECT: subject of the e-mail in xmitip format
    (the word SUBJECT: is required)
    xmitip variables are allowed
4 - dataset name of a sequential or a member of a pds with
    a xmitip addressfile
5 - dataset name of a sequential file or a member of a pds
    with the message text to be delivered
6 - REPLYTO e-mail address to receive any bounces or replies
    to the sent e-mail

Records after 6 are ignored and may be used for comments

Records 4 and 5 may reference a member of the control pds if
desired (not a bad idea).
