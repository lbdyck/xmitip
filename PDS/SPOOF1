Spoofing is the use of a different identify from your own. With SMTP
this is possible using the FROM address, which can be anything and which
is not validated.

To help prevent spoofing several changes have been made to XMITIP:

1. The SMTP header SENDER is set automatically to the senders
   tsouser@tso-hostname (SYSLBD@NKAISERA.CRDC.KP.ORG) which allows
   anyone to review the SMTP headers to see who originated the e-mail.
   (controlled by the XMTIIPCU setting SEND_FROM)

2. A XMITIPCU configuration option called antispoof which, if set, will
   cause a block of information to be included as the last lines of
   every e-mail generated by XMITIP. This is optional.

   In XMITIPCU the userid is separated from the name by ## as is
   the user name from the system info.

   The message block will look something like this:

   * ------------------------- 5.69 -------------------------- *
   * E-Mail originated from:                                   *
   * Jobname:       SYSLBD         Job Number:    TSU51775     *
   * Userid:        SYSLBD         User Name:     DYCK, LIONEL *
   * System:        MSYS           Node:          NKAISERA     *
   * Date:          October 5, 2007  07:22:13  (Friday)        *
   * --------------------------------------------------------- *

   If the e-mail is generated from a batch job the message block will
   look like this:

   * ------------------------- 5.69f ------------------------- *
   * E-Mail originated from:                                   *
   * Jobname:       SYSLBDD        Job Number:    JOB53467     *
   * Userid:        SYSLBD         User Name:     DYCK, LIONEL *
   * System:        ASYS           Node:          NKAISERA     *
   * Date:          October 5, 2007  07:33:54  (Friday)        *
   * --------------------------------------------------------- *

Be aware that this is only for SMTP e-mail originating with XMITIP. Any
other use of SMTP e-mail from OS/390 and z/OS will still be open to
spoofing.
