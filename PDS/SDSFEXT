SDSFEXT

    This utility is a rexx exec designed to use SDSF to extract a specific
    DDname for every JOB in the spool that matches the specified jobname.
    The extracted data is then placed into a pre-allocated dataset
    referenced by a DDname in the command.

Syntax:   %sdsfext jobname report-dd extract-dd ( options

Where:    jobname is a specific jobname that will be found in the JES2 SPOOL
                  or * for the currently active job

          report-dd is the DDname in the job that will be extracted
                 or (ddname1 ddname2 ...)
                 ddname may be a specific ddname or stepname.ddname
                 or stepname.procstep.ddname

          extract-dd is the DDname in the SDSFEXT step that references a
                     dataset where the extracted reports will be copied.

          ( is required if any options are specified

          options currently supported are:

          ACTIVE   - only process jobs that are currently executing.
                     ** this can be used if using SDSFEXT as a step
                        within a job
                     ** set on if JOBNAME = *

          DEBUG   - display sdsf options and report

          INPUT   - allows selection of input data

Installation:

    To install just copy the SDSFEXT member of this dataset into a library
    in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.

Notes:

    1. No masking is allowed in the jobname or the report-dd
    2. The jobs are sorted based on start date and processed oldest to newest
       based on the Status (ST) display.
    3. Only the first matching DDname is processed as the code is not in
       place at this time to test for multiple matches.
    4. There is no way to test for stepname at this time either
    5. This obviously requires IBMs SDSF

Sample JCL:

    //jobname  JOB  .....
    //*       * ---------------------------------- *
    //*       * Sample Batch TMP to invoke sdsfext *
    //*       * ---------------------------------- *
    //TSOA EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
    //         PARM='%sdsfext smtp logfile log'
    //SYSEXEC  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.sdsfext.exec
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
    //LOG      DD DSN=hlq.LOGFILE.LIST,DISP=(,CATLG),
    //            UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(300,300),RLSE),
    //            DCB=(RECFM=VB,LRECL=255,BLKSIZE=23440)
    //SYSTSIN  DD DUMMY
    /*

    In this example:
    * The SYSEXEC references the REXX library where the SDSFEXT command
      has been installed.
    * The SYSPRINT and SYSTSPRT are used by the IKJEFT1B program which
      is the TSO Batch Terminal Monitor Program (TMP)
    * The LOG DD refers to a temporary dataset that is where the
      extracted reports will be placed.
    * The command is in the step execution parm.
    * The jobname is SMTP and the Report-DD is LOGFILE with the output
      going to the LOG DD.
