Return Receipt Mapping   Choose one:

    * Use Disposition-Notification-To - (default) When converting an
    outbound Notes message that includes a Return receipt request into
    MIME format, the server converts the Notes ReturnReceipt item into
    the MIME header item Disposition-Notification-To.
