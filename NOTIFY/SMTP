//*        SYSPRINT points to a data set used for the output from
//*        internal calls to IDCAMS.  It can be a temporary data set.
//*
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//*
//*        SYSERR contains runtime diagnostics from Pascal.  It can be
//*        a data set or SYSOUT.
//*
//SYSERR   DD SYSOUT=*
//*
//*        SYSDEBUG receives output that is generated when the DEBUG
//*        configuration statement is specified in SMTP.  It can be
//*        a data set or SYSOUT.
//*
//SYSDEBUG DD SYSOUT=*
//*
//*        OUTPUT contains the startup and shutdown messages from SMTP.
//*        It can be a data set or SYSOUT.
//*
//OUTPUT   DD SYSOUT=*
//*
//*        LOGFILE receives output that is generated when the LOG
//*        configuration statement is specified in SMTP.  It can be
//*        a data set or SYSOUT.
//*
//*        LOGFILE routed to OPSMVS via generic dataset interface
//*        for automation purposes. OPSMAIN must be started first
//*        else this procedure will 'JCL ERROR'.
//*
//*LOGFILE  DD SYSOUT=*
//LOGFILE  DD SUBSYS=(OPSS,OPSDSN,PINK,SMTP)
//*
//*        SMTPNJE is the output of the SMTPNJE command.
//*        Before running SMTP you should use the SMTPNJE command
//*        to create the data set and then you can remove the
//*        "*" from the following line to activate SMTPNJE.
//*
//SMTPNJE  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=TCPIP.SPRO.SMTPNJE.HOSTINFO
//*
//*        CONFIG points to a sample configuration data set.
//*        Before running SMTP you should modify this file to
//*        include parameters suitable for your installation.
//*        Refer to the Chapter "Configuring the SMTP Server"
//*        in the Customization and Administration Guide.
//*
//CONFIG   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.TCPPARMS(SMTPCONF)
//*
//*        SECTABLE points to your SMTP security table data set.
//*        If you are running with the SECURE option, this data set
//*        will contain a list of NJE users who are authorized to
//*        use the gateway.  Refer to the Chapter "Configuring the
//*        SMTP Server" in the Customization and Administration Guide.
//*        You must remove the "*" from the following line to allow
//*        SMTP to find the data set.
//*
//*SECTABLE DD DSN=SMTP.SMTP.SECTABLE,DISP=SHR
//*
//*        SMTPRULE points to the data set containing the rewrite rules
//*        for the header addresses. You must specify REWRITE822HEADER
//*        YES for this data set to be read. Refer to the Chapter
//*        "Configuring the SMTP Server" in the Customization and
//*        Administration Guide.  You must remove the "*" from the
//*        following line to allow SMTP to find the data set.
//*
//SMTPRULE DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.TCPPARMS(SMTPRULE)
//*
//*        SYSTCPD explicitly identifies which data set is to be
//*        used to obtain the parameters defined by TCPIP.DATA.
//*        The SYSTCPD DD statement should be placed in the TSO logon
//*        procedure or in the JCL of any client or server executed
//*        as a background task. The data set can be any sequential
//*        data set or a member of a partitioned data set (PDS).
//*
//*        For more information please see "Understanding TCP/IP Data
//*        Set Names" in the Customization and Administration Guide.
