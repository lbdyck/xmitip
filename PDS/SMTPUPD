SMTPUPD is from Ken Garrett and can be used to update the SMTP Security
table of valid/authorized TSO userids allowed to send SMTP mail.

This code needs to be modified by each installation to:

   1. point to the SMTP Security data set
   2. create the %PSMTP command to interact with an automation package
      to stop/start the SMTP started task
