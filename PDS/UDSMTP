Installation and Configuration for use of UDSMTP

UDSMTP is a SMTP delivery program written by Mike Porter of the
University of Delaware and made available for free download from
http://www.dignus.com/freebies/#udsmtp and included in the distributed
XMITIP.LOAD library as part of the XMITIP package.

Thanks to Mike the source is now available in a tarball in member
UDSMTPS. You will need to GUNZIP and then unTar it and then compile
with your favorite C compiler. You will need to download to a
workstation in binary and then run expand it.  The original name is
XMITIP.UDSMTP.TAR.GZ which should give you an idea that it is GZIP's
and Tar'd.

UDSMTP can be used if you do not have a TCP/IP SMTP Server active on
your OS/390 or z/OS system.  It does require that a TCP/IP stack be
active however.

To use it you need to do the following:

1. Copy the load module from the provided load library into:
   a) a library in your LINKLIST
   b) a STEPLIB library that you will use
   c) a library that is accessible by your users

2. Update the XMITIPCU customization REXX EXEC:
   a) if UDSMTP is not installed in the LINKLIST or a STEPLIB then set
      variable smtp_loadlib to the name of the load library where
      UDSMTP can be found.
   b) Set smtp_method to UDSMTP
   c) Set smtp_server to the name of your in house SMTP SERVER
      where UDSMTP will deliver all mail for eventual delivery

3. To secure who uses UDSMTP you can use your security package to
   restrict access to the library where UDSMTP is installed.

That's it.

Cautions:

When using UDSMTP you need to be aware that:

1. If the SMTP server it is trying to deliver e-mail to is down it
   will fail.
2. UDSMTP does not queue and retry if there is a delivery failure.
