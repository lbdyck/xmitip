This member documents the native MVS Sockets search order for the
Resolver related configuration file TCPIP.DATA. This configuration file
is used by TSO/E REXX SOCKET API calls like gethostid, gethostname and
getdomainname in XMITIPCU.

TCPIP will use the first-found occurrence:

  1. via the //SYSTCPD DD statement
  2. jobname.TCPIP.DATA or userid.TCPIP.DATA
     The MVS batch jobname or your TSO userid prefix setting.
  3. SYS1.TCPPARMS(TCPDATA)
  4. hlq.TCPIP.DATA
     the hlq typically defaults to TCPIP (or the stack's name)

If you are not using one of the system defined naming conventions
described in items (2), (3), and (4), then you need to include the
ddname SYSTCPD, descibed in item (1), in the TSO Logon Proc allocations
and in any batch JCL using XMITIP.
