PDF Security is accomplished using two routines developed by Leland
Lucius.  These routines are T2PARC4 and T2PMD5 which can be browsed in
the ASM library shipped with this package.

XMITIP will support the following security features of the Adobe Acrobat
PDF file:

    * Prevent Editing
    * Prevent Copying of Text
    * User password to prevent a user from reading the file without
      specifying the password when prompted

Both 40-bit and 128-bit are supported. Here is the description from the
module prolog:

          This external REXX function implements the "Alleged RC4"
          (or ARC4) algorithm as posted to sci.crypt in 1994.  This
          algorithm may or may not produce similar results to the
          real RC4 algorithm and no claim is made otherwise. UAYOR

To use the 128-bit encryption the client must be using Adobe Acrobat 5.0
or newer.

Note that the TXT2PDF routine supports more security options than are
supported by XMITIP at this time. To use the other options you will need
to do the Text to PDF conversion outside XMITIP.
