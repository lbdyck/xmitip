Command: ALLOCGDG

Syntax:  %Allocgdg ddn dsname(n)

Operands:

DDN       A DDname or *

          If a DDname then the requested GDG will be allocated to
          this DDname.

          If * then the absolute GDG DSname will be returned to the
          caller (see example)

DSNAME(n) The data set name with relative generation to be processed.

          n may be 0 for the current generation
                   negative for a prior generation
                   positive (e.g. +1) for a new generation that has
                        been created in the current job but which is
                        not in the catalog yet (should not be a
                        problem for current levels of OS/390 (2.7+)).

Example:

      /* rexx */
      call allocgdg gdgdd "'hlq.product(-3)'"

      /* rexx */
      fulldsn = allocgdg("*" "'hlq.product(-3)'")
