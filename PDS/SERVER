This document/member has two sections (OS/390 and z/OS):

If you want your z/OS or OS/390 SMTP Server to send all mail to an
existing mail server within your enterprise do the following:

OS/390 2.10 and before:

1. Find the dataset pointed to by the SYSTCPD DD in the TCPIP started
   task JCL and make a copy for use in the SMTP started task JCL.

2. In the copy of (1) comment out the NSINTERADDR statements.  These
   statements are used to define the domain name servers that will
   be used to resolve host names.

3. In the SMTP CONFIG data add the IPMAILERADDRESS statement.  The
   syntax is IPMAILERADDRESS xx.xx.xx.xx where the xx.xx.xx.xx is
   the numeric IP address of the target mail server.

z/OS:

1. In the SMTP CONFIG data add the IPMAILERADDRESS statement.  The
   syntax is IPMAILERADDRESS xx.xx.xx.xx where the xx.xx.xx.xx is
   the numeric IP address of the target mail server.

2. In the SMTP CONFIG data add the statement:

   RESOLVERUSAGE NO

SMTP will now forward all mail for which it is unable to resolve the
target host name to the server defined in the IPMAILERADDRESS.

z/OS 1.3 with PQ71580 or z/OS 1.4 with PQ73161

1. In the SMTP CONFIG data remove IPMAILERADDRESS and replace
   with IPMAILERNAME mail.host ALL

2. In the SMTP CONFIG add the statement:

   RESOLVERUSAGE YES
