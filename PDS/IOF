This is a note from Jim Walker (developer of IOF):

I have recently developed a rather nice interface to XMITIP from IOF.
The SENDMAIL interface is described in detail in the September 2007
IOF Newsletter at:

   http://www.triangle-systems.com/nl0709.shtml

SENDMAIL is an interactive command that can send Jobs, Output Groups,
or sysout data sets via XMITIP.  The IOFSNDME Rexx exec can be run in
batch TSO to send the current job via email.  Both facilities send an
IOF Job Summ panel and optionally the sysout data sets of a job as
HTML.

If you are an IOF customer then you will WANT to use this.
