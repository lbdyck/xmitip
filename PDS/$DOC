NOTE: A STEPLIB or update to linklist is now required to use this code.

Installation Step 1:
    To execute the RECEIVE member issue
       "TSO EXEC 'hlq.pds-dsname(RECEIVE)' EXEC"
    This will create the rexx, panels, etc. libraries and place you in
    ISPF Browse on some key members.
Installation Step 2.
    Update XMITIPCU - see the Installation Guide.

Optional packages that you might need/want:

         TXT2PDF used for the text to PDF conversion
                 for file attachments

Updates and the optional packages can be found

For Disclaimer support:

Update XMITIPCU variable with the fully qualified data set name of a
data set which contains your installations standard disclaimer.  The
contents of this data set will be included with every e-mail for which a
message is generated.

IMPORTANT: Local customizations should be made in the XMITIPCU rexx
exec and in the XMITLDAP rexx exec:

  XMITIPCU - general customizations
  XMITIPDT - change NLS days and months if not English
  XMITLDAP - customizations related to the use of ldap to verify and/or
             find e-mail addresses.
  XMITIPML - you may need to customize this exec if the ldap server
             returns information in a format different from what
             is defined. (if you change this you should remember what
             you changed for future updates and if you can generalize
             what you've done let me know).
             PLUS you may need to change the comments on the panel
             XMITIPML.

If you need to change the dollar symbol to a pound or you need to change
the PDF ebcdic->ascii translation table then you need to update
XMITIPTR.

   e.g. For the dollar to pound change location 5B to be A3

ZIP Notes:
1. PKZIP/MVS can be found at www.asizip.com
2. ISPZIP can be found at www.ase.com.au
3. ZIP390 can be found at www.data21.com
4. InfoZip is now supported
   - load module (zip) is provided in the load library
   - does not support name-in-archive for pds members
   - infozip must be installed in a steplib or in linklist ****
   - you may need to download and recompile InfoZip if you need
     a different ASCII character set.
   - *** Check out this for more info
         http://www.mildredbrennan.com/blog/?p=309
5. PKZIP/MVS pre 2.51 does not support the name-in-archive option
6. PKZIP/MVS version 5 has a problem with mixed case commands
   XMITIP has been fixed to generate upper case commands for
   PKZIP/MVS V5.  Now it seems that ASI has a patch to allow
   mixed case - available at their web site.
7. PKZIP/MVS Version 5 requires fix level 508 at a minimum
8. ISPZIP issues
   - does not support ZIPPASS or ZIPMETHOD
   - does not support name-in-archive for pds members
   - resultant zip file does not work with Infozip
     or Lotus Notes Viewer
