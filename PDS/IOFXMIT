This member (document) describes how to setup and use the XMITSDSF
command within IOF to e-mail a sysout file.

(I know this is being used for IOF but the command and generated rtf
 are based upon the code for SDSF which is why the you see SDSF here)

Overview

XMITSDSF is a rexx command that is invoked from a Program Function Key
when browsing a spool file in IOF.  The PFK setup will snap the
currently viewed spool file to a disk file and then invoke XMITSDSF
which will then invoke XMITIPFE (a front-end to the XMITIP ISPF
interface).  This allows the user to relatively easily e-mail the spool
file.  Upon return from XMITIPFE the XMITSDSF will delete the snaped
file on disk.

The XMITSDSF will setup the file for e-mailing as an RTF file with a
filename of SDSFhhmm.RTF and a format of Landscape orientation, 9 point
font, and letter size paper.

Setup

To setup this:

1. Start IOF
2. Enter KEYS on the ISPF Command line
3. Pick a PFK to change and then change it to:
   sd da(iof.list);up max;sn 99999;snapclos;tso %xmitsdsf iof.list
4. Then PF3 to save and close the KEYS dialog

To use:

1. Start IOF
2. Do a ? next to a job to list the individual dd's
3. Do a S next to the desired dd (spool file) to browse it
4. Press the selected PFK
5. Fill in the recipients e-mail address on the XMITIP ISPF panel
6. Press enter to send
