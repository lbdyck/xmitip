This member contains a list of requested enhancements.

1. provide XML support
2. read input files in increments to reduce required storage
3. customize variables via ispf dialog instead of xmitipcu
4. conditional coding (if, then, else)
5. move site disclaim and antispoof to after attachments

There is no guarantee that these will ever be implemented but I am
keeping track of them. If anyone would like to offer the coding or
suggestions on how to implement these features I would be very grateful.
