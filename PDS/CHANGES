          member.suffix where suffix is appropriate to the
          attachment type.
        - add size limit (in xmitipcu) and test in xmitip
        - lntegrated suggestion from Leland Lucius for converting
          during the HTML conversion the characters <>&" into
          &lt; &gt; &amp; and &quot; so that they will display
          properly.

          logfile and issue messages to the user about incoming mail.
        - addition of member IEFDB401 from University of Florida (NERDC)
          which has been modified by Lionel Dyck (thus blame me if it
          doesn't work).  This is a dynamic allocation exit that will

            to be a filename and will be used for the name of the
            attachment.
          - the file attachment table now retains all referenced
            files
          - this is now a selection table - only those files selected
