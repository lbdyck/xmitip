Thoughts for using SENDMAIL instead of the z/OS SMTP service to deliver
mail from the mainframe.

These are notes and there is nothing in XMITIP to support this at this
point in time.

If someone wants to try coding this to get it working please let me know.
============================================================================
One to do has been to enable the option of using the Unix System Services
sendmail for mail delivery. Here are my thoughts:

Create a command line option to select 'sendmail' for delivery rather if not
defined in XMITIPCU as the default.

Then in the code:

1: create bcc: xxx@x.y in the envelop
2: do not create any statement in the header (helo, rcpt, mail from, data)
3. write to a temp file
4. "oput mail_file '/tmp/tmpmail.file'"  (where tmpmail.file is unique)
4a. delete the temp file
5. "bpxbatch sendmail < '/tmp/tmpmail.file'"
6. "bpxbatch rm '/tmp/tmpmail.file'"

a) don't know if we can trap the output from bpxbatch
b) also about error handling
c) sendmail.cf will have to be properly configured
