(SMTP for OS/390)
by Matt Martin (MMARTI22@email.usps.gov)

The SMTP protocol easily allows you to send an e-mail message to someone
and have it appear to be from whomever you want it to be from.  This
can be somewhat controlled by using the secure feature of SMTP.

Warning:  This does not work well if you have special characters in your
name side.

Example: First.Last@mainframe.myurl.com.  The period "." between
First and Last will cause problems.  Long alpha numeric names are ok as
long as they do not have special characters.

Example: FirstMiddleInitialLast@mainframe.myurl.com is acceptable.

One requirement of secure SMTP is that messages (spooled files) have to
be in netdata format.  The TSO XMIT command can be used to read "text"
SMTP files and create a netdata spool file.  XMIT puts your TSOID and
JES2 node in the netdata file.  If you see NODENAME in your netdata
spool file then you need to change your IKJTSO00 parameter:

In IKJTSO00 change your NODESMF parameter to "NODESMF((*,*))".
Dynamically update this change with TSO command "PARMLIB UPDATE(00).

Now your netdata spool file has your JES2 node instead of NODENAME.
(Note: Your IKJTSOnn member may have a different suffix.)

In  SMTPCONF add SECURE.

Create a data set or member and add a SECTABLE DD statement to your SMTP
proc that references this data set.

SECTABLE
MYUSER  JES2NODE  THOMAS   N Y
SYSPROG JES2NODE  THOMAS   Y N
SYSPROG JES2NODE  MARTIN   Y Y

In this example your system person (you) has a TSOID of SYSPROG and an
e-mail address of martin@mainframe.myurl.com.  Your user has a TSOID of
MYUSER and an e-mail address of thomas@mainframe.myurl.com.

In the SMTP message Thomas would code:

mail from:<MYUSER@JES2NODE>
from:      MYUSER@JES2NODE

When secure SMTP reads the spool file it will see that it is owned by
MYUSER and is from JES2NODE.   Secure SMTP will then see that the
netdata file was created by MYUSER at JES2NODE.   Secure SMTP will then
change both the MAIL FROM and the FROM to thomas@mainframe.myurl.com.

The reason there are two records for nickname THOMAS is because SYSPROG
didn't want users to receive mainframe e-mail.  Any mail addressed to
thomas, SMTP will re-address to SYSPROG at JES2NODE.

If any TSOID other than SYSPROG or MYUSER try to send an e-mail it will
fail with: EZA5463E 11/09/01 13:03:39 Unregistered BSMTP Spool File

If SYSPROG tried to send FROM (and MAIL FROM) MYUSER it would also
fail.  In the spool file created you can see message:
Spool File Origin: <SYSPROG@JES2NODE> does not match Sender's Address:
MYUSER@JES2NODE

Using this secure method will limit you to one e-mail address for each
userid.  If you have multiple applications that are assigned the same
userid (such as PRODUSR), you will only be able to use one e-mail
address.

You may notice that the REWRITEHEADER822 and SMTPRULE data set were not
used to control "from spoofing".  This is because the REWRITEHEADER822
does not control the MAIL FROM address.  The MAIL FROM address is
part of the RFC 821 "standard".  The REWRITEHEADER822 can be used
to change the FROM address to a name that contains special characters.
This could produce:
mail from: <martin@mainframe.myurl.com>
from:      matt.martin@mainframe.myurl.com

(Your original SMTP file has your TSOID and JES2NODE, and was
converted to a netdata format spool file.  It is the nickname of the
SECTABLE and the REWRITEHEADER822 that are converting your e-mail
addresses.)
We see that the MAIL FROM and FROM are not the same value, which is not
a good configuration.  Some e-mail applications (recipient side) will
use the FROM and others will use the MAIL FROM.
