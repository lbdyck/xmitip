Use of Distribution List (aka AddressFiles):

Distribution lists are supported using the AddressFile and AddressFileDD
keywords.  Only a single data set (AddressFile) or ddname
(AddressFileDD) may be used.

The AddressFile data set format is:

Fixed or Variable record length.

     Column 1
     * indicates a comment
     action of To, CC, or BCC

     Column after the action
     blank

     Column after the blank
     a valid e-mail address

Example:

* Example Distribution List
To john.doe@corp.com
cc "John B. Doe" <john.doe@corp.com>
bCC john.doe@corp.com

The action and the address is case insensitive.

When using the ISPF interface the Address Table dialog the following
options are available:

Commands:

   SAVEAF
   Saves the addresses selected in the table to a data set. The data set
   may be created using Disposition of New if it doesn't exist. Once
   created or saved the data set name and description will be saved in
   the Address Table.  At the time the addresses are saved the ISPF
   dialog variable for the AddressFile will be set and it will be used
   for that dialog invocation, and the selected addresses will be
   unselected to prevent duplicate e-mails.

   The popup prompt for this action allows the Description of the
   distribution list to be changed.

   LOADAF
   Loads the addresses from an existing AddressFile distribution data
   set.  The action requested in the list will be set (e.g. To, CC, BCC)
   and any new addresses will be added. The AddressFile data set will be
   added to the Address Table if it isn't already there.

   Note: Multiple AddressFile data sets may be loaded to create a more
   complete distribution list.

Selection Options:

   L
   Performs the same function as the LOADAF but using the AddressFile
   distribution list entry from the Address Table.

   D
   Delete the table entry for the AddressFile leaving the data set
   intact.
