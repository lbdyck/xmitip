         * Function:  to update all xmitip ispf panels to work with   *
         *            pre z/os systems that do not support the panel  *
         *            ver (..,dsnameq) option by changing dsnameq to  *

         *            Must be run after the RECEIVE exec has been     *
         *            run to build the XMITIP libraries.              *

         * Note:      This applies to anything before OS/390 2.10     *
         *                                                            *

         *            1. must be run after the RECEIVE exec has       *
         *               reconstructed the XMITIP libraries           *
         *            2. the oldose edit macro must be in the same    *
         *               library as this exec                         *
         *            3. must be run under ISPF                       *
         *                                                            *
         * Use:       An easy way to use this is to use ISPF 3.4      *
         *            to list the xmitip received libraries including *
         *            the installation pds. Then enter EDIT next to   *
         *            the installation pds (where you will find this  *
         *            member). Then enter EXEC next to this member    *
         *            in the member list to execute it.               *
         *                                                            *
         *            Use of the TRYIT exec also works.               *
         *            (look on the site where you got XMITIP for it)  *
         *                                                            *
