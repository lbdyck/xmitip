Important message about the charuse option.

This option was added because some mail systems (MS Exchange) were
objecting to the character set for RTF attachments and processing them
as text.

The options for charuse are:

  0 Use the charset for all mime sections

  1 Use the charset for the message and all sections EXCEPT for
    text and rtf file attachment
