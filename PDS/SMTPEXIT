SMTPEXIT - A SMTP Server Exit to Filter Unwanted Mail

This exit is documented in the IBM Communications Server IP
Configuration Guide and provided as a sample in the SEZAINST library.
The version included with this package has been customized to do the
following:

   1. reject redirect routing where an e-mail is sent to a address
      like user%domain.com@your-domain.com
   2. reject incoming mail that does not come from your companies
      domain

This is intended to prevent spam as well as prevent your z/OS SMTP
Server from being used to deliver spam to others.

Caveat: This will NOT prevent 100% of spam as a spammer could create a
        FROM address that appears to be from your domain.

The requirements to use this exit are:

    - z/OS 1.2 Communication Server

The installation steps are:

1. Update the source code to change the IDTABLE to include your
   companies domain name(s). For example if you are IBM you would
   specify IBM.COM - not US.IBM.COM unless you want to really be
   restrictive.

2. The exit must be assembled and linked as RENT, AMODE(31), and
   Authorized and placed into an authorized link (recommended) or lpa
   library.

3. Update your PROGxx member of PARMLIB to include the statement
   EXIT ADD EXITNAME(EZBTCPIPSMTPEXIT) MODNAME(SMTPEXIT)

   *** Note that the PROGxx EXIT statement the MODNAME can be what
   ever name you choose to name the exit load module - it does not
   have to be SMTPEXIT.  However the EXITNAME must remain as specified
   here.

The exit will now be active with the next IPL.

If you don't want to wait for an IPL, or you want to update the exit
dynamically then these steps are necessary:

1. The exit must be assembled and linked as RENT, AMODE(31), and
   Authorized and placed into an authorized link (recommended) or lpa
   library.

2. Update your PROGxx member of PARMLIB to include the statement
   EXIT ADD EXITNAME(EZBTCPIPSMTPEXIT) MODNAME(SMTPEXIT)

3. Create another PROGxx member of PARMLIB with this statement:
   EXIT DELETE EXITNAME(EZBTCPIPSMTPEXIT) MODNAME(SMTPEXIT) FORCE(YES)

4. Create a CSVLLAxx member of PARMLIB with this statement:
   LIBRARIES(your.linklist.library)

   Where your.linklist.library is where you installed the load module.

5. Issue from an operator console (or console interface):
   - F LLA,UPDATE=xx    (the xx from the CSVLLAxx)
   - T PROG=xx          (the xx from the PROGxx with EXIT DELETE)
   - T PROG=xx          (the xx from the PROGxx with EXIT ADD)

6. From an authorized (see the SMTP Config SMSGAUTHLIST) TSO Userid
   Issue:

        smsg tcpsmtp stopexit
   and then
        smsg tcpsmtp startexit

   ** where tcpsmtp is the name of the SMTP started task
