The SMTPSTAT rexx exec is a rough start at generating usage statistics
for the IBM OS/390 SMTP Server.  To use it:

1. tailor the STATJCL member of this data set
2. submit the STATJCL and review the e-mail'd results
3. note that the limit used for reporting is hard coded in the SMTPSTAT exec

NOTE: This is a work in progress and suggestions and code contributions
      are welcome.

SMTPSTAT processes the SMTP LOGFILE and generates statistics.  Here is a
sample:
