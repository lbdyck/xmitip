StemPush and StemPull are REXX Functions written by Rob Scott
(rscott@rs.com).

These routines are only used if you define the smtp_method to be
"SOCKETS" which then uses the XMITSOCK routine.  This approach is uses
REXX Sockets programming to send the e-mail without using the z/OS
TCP/IP SMTP Server or the provided UDSMTP routine.

It is possible that these routines will be used elsewhere within
XMITIP - however their use will be optional.

You can find them at:

Here is the description from this page:

These two external REXX functions enable the easy passing of one or
more REXX stems between Execs that are running in the same address
space. The stem variables are placed on a dataspace stack by the
STEMPUSH function, and retrieved from that stack by the STEMPULL
function. Multiple stacks can exist concurrently as each stack is
given a unique identifier.
