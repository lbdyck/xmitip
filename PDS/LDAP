LDAP, or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is available for use
with XMITIP to both validate and to query e-mail addresses.

NOTE: The LDAP interface is shipped disabled.

To use the XMITLDAP rexx exec needs to be edited thus:

Variable      Value
--------      -------------------------------------------
ldap_server = host name of your ldap server
              OR 0 (zero) to disable completely
ldap_o      = Organization and Country for LDAP queries
local_nodes = domain names from e-mail addresses that will
              be checked.  All others will be ignored as they
              are probably external and not in your LDAP
              mail directory.
ldap_name   = the qualifier for the name - typically cn=
ldap_mail   = the qualifier for the mail - typically mail=

Examples:
ldap_server = "mailhub.kp.org"
   or ldap_server = 0 /* to disable */
ldap_o      = "o=organization name,c=US"
local_nodes = "xyz.com'
ldap_name   = 'cn='
ldap_mail   = 'mail='

Other setup required is:

In XMITIPCU:

   /* ----------------------------------------------------- *
    * Allow E-Mail address (ID) validation in batch         *
    * 0 = allow    1 = do NOT allow                         *
    * ----------------------------------------------------- */
    batch_idval = 0

Notes:
1. One key piece is to insure that the LDAP Load Library is in your
   Linklist.  This library is shipped as GLD.SGLDLNK.
2. Each user must have an OMVS segment
   ** I've updated the GLDSRCH command so this isn't required
   ** but it is better if they do.
3. If you have command limiting enabled then you need to add the TSO
   Command GLDSRCH to that list as this is the LDAP search command
   used.

Usage Notes:

If enabled and batch_idval is enabled then the XMITIP exec will validate
all local e-mail addresses.  Should you wish to turn this off you can
use the new keyword NOIDVAL with XMITIP.

If the XMITIP is invoked from the ISPF Dialog (XMITIPI) then the e-mail
address validation will only occur in XMITIPI and not in the XMITIP.

In the ISPF Dialog if the e-mail address table is used, and LDAP is
enabled, there will be a new command option of LOOKUP.  This will
display a panel from which the user can enter a name, or name pattern,
that will be used to query the LDAP mail directory.  All names and
accompanying addresses will be displayed in a selection table.  These
names and addresses can then be added to the users e-mail address table.
